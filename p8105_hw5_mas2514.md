## Problem 1

The code below creates a function that, for a fixed group size, randomly
draws “birthdays” for each person, checks whether there are duplicate
birthdays in the group, and returns `TRUE` or `FALSE` based on the
result.

``` r
bday_sim = function(n_room) {
  
  birthdays = sample(1:365, n_room, replace = TRUE)

  repeated_bday = length(unique(birthdays)) < n_room

  repeated_bday
  
}
```

The code below runs the `bday_sim` function 10,000 times for each group
size between 2 and 50, and computes the probability that at least two
people in a given group will share a birthday.

``` r
bday_sim_results <- 
  expand_grid(
    bdays = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    result = map_lgl(bdays, bday_sim)
  ) |> 
  group_by(
    bdays
  ) |> 
  summarize(
    prob_repeat = mean(result)
  ) |> 
  view()
```

This plot shows the probability calculated above as a function of group
size.

``` r
bday_sim_results |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = bdays, y = prob_repeat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

From the plot we can see that as group size increases, the probability
that at least two people will share a birthday increases. There is a 25%
chance of at least two people sharing a birthday once the group size
reaches 15, a 50% chance once the group size reaches 23, a 75% chance
once the group size reaches approximately 32, and almost a 100% chance
once the group passes 50. These results indicate that a large sample
size is not necessarily needed for two people to likely share a
birthday.
